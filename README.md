## 🌟 Introduction

This notebook provides a comprehensive guide for training and evaluating the TROCR model. The TROCR model leverages the power of transformers for accurate and efficient OCR, making it suitable for various text recognition tasks.

## ⚙️ Installation

To get started, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install -q transformers
pip install -q sentencepiece
pip install -q jiwer
pip install -q datasets
pip install -q evaluate
pip install -q -U accelerate
pip install -q matplotlib
pip install -q protobuf==3.20.1
pip install -q tensorboard
```

## 🖥️ Environment Setup

Set up your environment with the following steps:

1. **Create and activate a Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n trocr python==3.8
    conda activate trocr
    ```

2. **Install PyTorch and other dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

Once your environment is set up, you can use the notebook to train and evaluate your TROCR model. Follow the structured cells in the notebook to:

1. **Import necessary libraries and set up configurations.**
2. **Prepare your dataset for training and validation.**
3. **Train the TROCR model using your dataset.**
4. **Evaluate the performance of the trained model.**
5. **Visualize results and metrics using tools like TensorBoard.**
